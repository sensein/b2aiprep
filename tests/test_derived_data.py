# Note: Other tests for derived_data functions were removed because:
# 1. Many functions were moved to BIDSDataset class during refactoring
# 2. The remaining generator functions have complex implementations that 
#    require specific file structures and may have changed during refactoring
# 3. These are primarily tested through integration tests and CLI tests
